# Hei Wukong Meme Coin Project

## 1. Project Inspiration
Hei Wukong is more than just a monkey. We combine the most rebellious and powerful figure from Eastern mythology—the Monkey King (“Qi Tian Da Sheng”)—with the meme culture of Web3 to create a brand new crypto IP for the global community: Hei Wukong.

## 2. Vision & Mission
In the crypto world, belief is everything. Hei Wukong stands for fearless rebellion, breaking the rules, and being born free. Through this meme coin project, we aim to unite those who dare to be different—bold Web3 pioneers—and build a truly community-driven, decentralized mythological universe.
