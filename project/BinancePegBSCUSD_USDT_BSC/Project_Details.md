1. Project Overview
1.1 Overview
- Project Name: USDT (Tether) Payment Protocol Based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Core Functions:
  - A USDT stablecoin payment system based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering low - transaction - fee and high - speed cross - border payment solutions.
  - Support for decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity mining, collateralized lending and borrowing, and on - chain transaction settlement.
- Target Market: Cryptocurrency traders, cross - border payment users, and participants in the DeFi ecosystem.

1.2 Background
- Market Demand: Traditional cross - border payments (such as the SWIFT system) have high transaction fees (3 - 5%) and long processing times (1 - 5 days). The cryptocurrency market lacks a stable and low - cost payment medium. As the largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of over $110 billion, USDT fills this gap.
- Industry Trends: Stablecoins account for more than 70% of the total cryptocurrency trading volume, and USDT accounts for more than 50% of that. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with its low gas fees (about $0.1 per transaction), has become one of the main circulation networks for USDT.

1.4 Project Features
- Competitive Advantages: Ultra - low transaction fees. The transfer fee for USDT on the BSC chain is only 1/100 of that of traditional cross - border payments (about $0.1). Support for multi - chain USDT swaps, such as BEP - 20, ERC - 20, TRC - 20, etc. Smart contract - based risk control that automatically freezes suspicious transaction addresses (more than $449 million in USDT related to illegal activities has been frozen).
