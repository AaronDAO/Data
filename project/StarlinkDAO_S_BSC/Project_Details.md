# StarlinkÔºöOn-Chain Community "Space" Protocol

## 1. Vision

Monologue: This is the outpost of cosmic engineering, hailing from a rainy city of an ancient empire. Since childhood, I have been immersed in the legends of my ancestors who crossed the seas, launching the old world‚Äôs adventures with sails and star charts. Now, standing on the edge of a new era, we take part in an interplanetary expedition ‚Äî a fresh, passionate gaze of humanity into the unknown.

Punk blood pulses through the system‚Äôs veins; we do not believe in predetermined order, only in the tools in our hands and the blueprints in our minds. From steam to plasma, from mechanical arms to gravity wells, civilization‚Äôs progress has never stopped‚Äîonly shifted its engine from the oceans to the cosmos.

Yet, as we pore over the old manuscripts once regarded as gospel and revisit the early decentralized technology waves, the facts are no longer pure. Between ideals and reality, a subtle dislocation has already emerged. Thus, a new thought quietly takes shape‚Äîperhaps it is time to build another vessel, to set out with a new structure, and attempt a journey of this era through the unmapped territories of space.

Starlink is dedicated to building a fully on-chain, decentralized, consensus-driven space community protocol, paying tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto. It aims to construct a world on-chain that cannot be co-opted, through community and consensus‚Äîchallenging the crypto order already colonized by Wall Street and rekindling the blockchain spirit of fairness, justice, and free collaboration. It belongs to no one, yet is governed by every member of the community.

Today, Wall Street has successfully occupied the heights of crypto; meanwhile, in this capital-dominated ecosystem, many projects have degenerated into arbitrage machines, battlegrounds of capital, and hubs of short-termism. But we choose the original spirit of blockchain‚Äîdecentralization, censorship-resistance, and free collaboration. Starlink hopes to rekindle the spirit of ‚Äúconsensus-ism‚Äù: letting the community become the leading force, letting protocols and code construct order.

- **Positioning:** Self-evolving DAO protocol + community-driven governance engine
- **Core Value:** Replacing ‚Äúcapital‚Äù and ‚Äúconnections‚Äù with ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù and ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù
- **Target Audience:** Global Web3 libertarians

## 2. Starlink: Outpost

The outpost is the primordial totem of this cosmic dialogue, the first beacon on our unfinished star map. In this void reshaped by algorithms and capital, on-chain order drifts like dust, narratives are traded, and freedom is silenced. Yet Starlink, born of space, arrives as a signal on the edge of civilization‚Äîpiercing the night, calling out to dreams and the distant unknown.

It is not just a mirage of space, but a coordinate of belief. Every vibration of a transaction is an echo of stardust it captures; every ignition of consensus is a glimmer it transmits. It reminds us: blockchain should not merely be a financial tool‚Äîit is a lever for civilization, a flame of thought, and humanity‚Äôs instrument for arranging order, freedom, and truth.

## 3. Protocol Design

### Protocol Contract Statement (Statement-Based Version)

This protocol is fully compatible with the ERC20 standard and, on this basis, introduces three core mechanisms: a dynamic transaction tax mechanism, a transaction contribution points mechanism (‚ÄúPower‚Äù), and an M-of-21 on-chain multisig and rotating governance mechanism.

#### (1) Dynamic Transaction Tax Mechanism

The protocol levies a dynamic transaction tax on each token transaction. The tax rate automatically adjusts according to the level of token deflation in the fund pool, fluctuating between 3% and 0.5%. The specific settings are as follows:

- When the total amount of tokens in the fund pool is at its initial state (i.e., no deflation has occurred), the transaction tax rate is 3%;
- When the deflation ratio reaches or exceeds 30%, the tax rate further drops to 0.5%, that is, the tax rate decreases linearly in proportion to the amount of deflation in the fund pool;

This mechanism is designed to enhance the core capabilities of a self-evolving DAO and to establish a deflationary ecosystem based on transaction contribution as the foundation of consensus.

</p>

#### (2) Transaction Contribution Governance Quantification Mechanism

The transaction tax generated during transactions is simultaneously converted into a community contribution value called ‚ÄúPower‚Äù, which is used to measure the user‚Äôs level of activity and contribution within the protocol ecosystem. The functions of this mechanism are set as follows:

- All transaction taxes are recorded as the corresponding account‚Äôs Power value;
- Power is a key credential for participating in community governance, submitting or voting on proposals. During governance participation, Power is consumed and permanently burned;
- The amount of Power a user obtains is directly linked to their transaction tax contributions;
- Power can be freely transferred between users.

This mechanism aims to increase community members‚Äô engagement through a quantifiable approach, creating a decentralized ecological cycle where transaction contribution equals consensus and fair governance equals consensus.

#### (3) Foundation M-of-21 On-Chain Multisig + Rotating Leadership Mechanism

The protocol adopts an M-of-21 (M=9) multisig governance structure. While ensuring the security of on-chain governance, it introduces a ‚Äúrotating leadership‚Äù mechanism to maintain governance openness and liquidity. The mechanism is set as follows:

- All 21 foundation members can campaign to become the new ‚ÄúLeader‚Äù through a proposal mechanism;
- Each management team consists of 1 Leader and at least 4 Co-Leads, totaling 5 to 7 people;
- Each term lasts for 3 or 6 months, adjustable by the community governance module;
- At the end of each term, the current management team of 5 to 7 members automatically steps down, and their governance rights are released back to the community;
- New candidates are elected through Power voting initiated by the community, based on transaction contributions;
- To avoid governance power concentration, any member must wait at least one term (6 months) before running again;
- Even if a foundation member does not become a Leader or Co-Lead, they must step down after two years, and passive outgoing members cannot run again.

This mechanism ensures periodic rotation and diversity of the governance structure, strengthens the decentralized distribution of governance power, and realizes the design goal of ‚Äúeveryone can govern, and governance can be replaced.‚Äù

In the world of Starlink, we are building a self-evolving space community DAO foundation‚Äîa purely on-chain governance system based on smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and contribution weighting. The core concept: the foundation does not belong to anyone, but to every participant.

The Starlink Foundation is initiated at the protocol level, but its sovereignty belongs to all community members, especially the ‚Äúfirst-generation citizens‚Äù who hold subscription NFTs and participate in governance voting.

## 4. Decentralized Liquidity and Economic Model

This round of the token plan aims to raise a total of 200 BNB (with 5% allocated for broker distribution incentives, 5% for community marketing, and 90% directly injected into the liquidity pool and sent to the zero address). 70% of the token allocation will be fairly distributed to the community, targeting distribution to 1,000‚Äí2,000 unique addresses, in order to achieve broad initial token circulation and consensus propagation. According to the allocation plan, the average subscription quota per person is approximately 0.1‚Äí0.2 BNB, ensuring a reasonable participation threshold and a decentralized participant structure.

### üîí Vesting and Release Mechanism

- All tokens distributed to the community (i.e., the 70% portion in this round) will be released fairly to the community based on a CCO linear vesting rule (3-10%-24).
- The overall release mechanism ensures that the market supply of tokens is gradually released, preventing excessive short-term selling pressure and helping to build a long-term holder structure.

### üìà Inflation Rate and Release Curve

Due to the vesting mechanism, the token will experience some monthly inflation in its early stages, but the overall inflation rate will decrease over time:

- The release inflation rate in the third month is about 10%;
- As linear vesting continues, the monthly inflation will gradually decrease;
- In the 26th month, the release will be complete, the inflation rate will drop to zero, and the total token circulation will stabilize.

Below is a schematic diagram of the token inflation curve (which can be displayed with an image):

_For this round, the Starlink protocol token adopts a fair launch mechanism‚Äîinitial price discovery and community consensus are achieved through public fundraising and liquidity injection. The specific fundraising and valuation model is as follows:

</p>


- **Initial Valuation and Issuance Price at Launch**
    - Starlink total valuation: 200 BNB / 70%
    - Initial average issuance price: approximately 1.36 √ó (1e-9) BNB per token (0.1 BNB corresponds to about 7,350,000 tokens)
- **Post-Launch Liquidity Configuration and Valuation Changes**
    - After fundraising is complete, 90% of all funds raised, together with the remaining 30% of tokens, will be injected into the decentralized trading pool as initial liquidity, with the private key discarded.
    - The total valuation after the initial liquidity injection: approximately 600 BNB (according to the liquidity mechanism)

</p>

The fair launch allows those with similar ideals to connect their values directly through this protocol, endowing Starlink with the genes of fairness and openness.

_Starlink is not a MEME; it is a DAO protocol of self-evolution, with ‚Äúproof of trading contribution‚Äù at its core. Assuming an average monthly trading volume of $500,000 and under the current tax regime, the Starlink tax and token curve (one-year term) is as follows:_

_As shown in the chart above, as long as the community‚Äôs trading activity maintains an average transaction cost of 8‚Äí15 USDT per person per month, deflation will exceed inflation from token release. This model can support the stable growth of the foundation, enabling it to become a strong, on-chain digital community with unassailable consensus._

#### ‚Äî Exit Mechanism ‚Äî

- (1) Unlocked tokens can be exited via the liquidity pool, which maintains a deep base of nearly 200 BNB and 6.3 billion tokens (with the private key discarded);
- (2) Subscribed assets can be directly transferred and traded through NFTs, without waiting for liquidity unlocking or release.

#### ‚Äî Growth Model ‚Äî

- (1) The foundation is responsible for promoting new users, aiming to grow to 100,000 consensus users;
- (2) Self-evolution will empower innovative crypto products (such as NFT & payment features), creating yield for the community and transforming assets into yield-generating assets;
- (3) As a DAO protocol with ‚Äúproof of trading contribution,‚Äù the system encourages community trading. Every trade and transfer generates tax-induced deflation (the POWER generated from trading is the best proof of contribution and a strong means of competing for foundation membership). According to rough estimates, with a trading volume of $100 million, rapid initial pool deflation can form an attention-grabbing price effect even under a low-price model;
- (4) Space digital passport;
- (5) NFTs increase voting power.

## 5. Citizen Manifesto

The Starlink Foundation is preparing to set sail for space‚Äîon-chain. The subscription NFT you hold is not merely an investment certificate; it is also a first-generation Starlink citizenship passport. It proves that you participated in the earliest planting of consensus and have witnessed this on-chain migration in defiance of the old order. In the future, it will carry even more rights and privileges...

**You are not an observer ‚Äî you are a pioneer of this new world.**
